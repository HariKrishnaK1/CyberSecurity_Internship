Capture & Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

What is Wireshark used for?
Wireshark is a free tool used to capture and analyze live network traffic. It helps identify protocols, troubleshoot network issues, and monitor data flow between systems.

What is a packet?
A packet is a small chunk of data sent over a network. It includes both the actual data and control information like source/destination. Think of it like a digital envelope carrying a message.

How to filter packets in Wireshark?
You can filter packets using the display filter bar. For example:

http shows only HTTP packets

tcp.port == 80 shows traffic on port 80

ip.addr == 192.168.0.1 filters for a specific IP address

What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-based. Used for emails, websites.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Faster, connectionless. Used in gaming, video calls.
Example: Watching a video call (UDP), downloading a file (TCP).

What is a DNS query packet?
Itâ€™s a request sent by your computer to a DNS server asking for the IP address of a website.
Example: Typing google.com sends a DNS query to get its IP.

How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
It allows you to see what data is being sent and received, helping to identify issues like slow loading, packet loss, or unauthorized access.

What is a protocol?
A protocol is a set of rules that define how devices communicate over a network.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, DNS, TCP/IP.

Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?
Not usually. Wireshark can't decrypt HTTPS or other encrypted traffic unless you have the keys and configure it properly.
