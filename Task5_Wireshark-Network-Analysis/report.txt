# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the results of a basic network traffic capture using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark 4.4.7

## Capturing Method
- Started capture on active Wi-Fi interface.
- Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging servers.
- Stopped capture after approx. 1 minute.

## Protocols Identified
1. **TCP** – Used for reliable data transfer (like loading websites or apps).
2. **HTTP** – Seen when accessing websites (e.g., file downloads).
3. **TLS/SSL** – Encrypted traffic for secure sites.
4. **DNS** – Domain resolution requests (e.g., google.com → IP).
5. **ICMP** – Ping requests to test connectivity.

## Key Observations
- Multiple HTTP GET requests were observed showing normal browsing activity.
- TCP 3-way handshakes (SYN, ACK) were clearly visible.
- No suspicious traffic detected.
- DNS queries and responses matched visited domains.

## File
The `.pcapng` file is included for full inspection in Wireshark.
