# 🔐 Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation  
**Cybersecurity Internship**

## 📌 Objective  
To understand what makes a password strong, test password strength using online tools, and learn best practices to enhance password security.

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity:
2. Used the website [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) to evaluate each password.
3. Noted the scores and feedback.
4. Analyzed patterns and security aspects.
5. Summarized best practices.

## 📊 Password Strength Table

| S.No | Password       | Complexity Level     | Strength Score (out of 100) |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| 1    | `123456`       | Very Weak            | 4                            |

## 🔑 Observations

- Short and predictable passwords (e.g., `123456`) are **very insecure**.
- Adding special characters and using mixed case letters boosts strength.
- The strongest passwords are long, unpredictable, and include symbols, numbers, and letters.
- A **password manager** can help you manage complex passwords safely.

## 📁 Deliverables

- **password_strength_report.txt** – Contains password scores and summary.
- Optional: Screenshots showing password strength tool usage.

## ✅ Outcome

Gained hands-on experience in evaluating passwords, understanding what makes them strong, and recognizing common weaknesses. Now aware of how to defend against **brute-force** and **dictionary** attacks by using complex and unique passwords.
