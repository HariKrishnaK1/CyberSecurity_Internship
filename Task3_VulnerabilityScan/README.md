# 🔒 Task 3: Vulnerability Scan on Local Machine

## ✅ Objective
The goal of this task was to perform a **basic vulnerability scan** on my local PC using **Nessus Essentials**, a free vulnerability scanner. This task helps build awareness about security flaws and teaches how to identify and analyze common vulnerabilities.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Nessus Essentials** (by Tenable)
- **Windows 10**
- **Command Prompt (Admin)** for troubleshooting updates

---

## 🧪 Steps Followed
1. Installed Nessus Essentials and completed plugin download & setup.
2. Registered and created a local user account for scanning.
3. Performed two scans:
   - **Host Discovery Scan**: Identified local machine as scan target.
   - **Basic Network Scan**: Performed a full vulnerability scan on the local machine.
4. Noted and analyzed reported vulnerabilities.

## 🔍 Vulnerabilities Found
| Vulnerability                        | Severity | Summary                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SMB Signing Not Required            | Medium   | Allows MITM attacks due to missing enforcement of SMB message signing. |
| SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted   | Medium   | Server uses untrusted or invalid SSL certificate.                      |

Screenshots are stored in the `screenshots` folder for both issues.
