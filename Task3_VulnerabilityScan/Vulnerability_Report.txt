# Vulnerability Scan Report - Task 3 (Cyber Security Internship)

## üìå Objective:
To perform a basic vulnerability scan on my local machine using **Nessus Essentials** and identify potential security risks. This report summarizes the findings and their implications.

---

## üîç Tool Used:
- **Nessus Essentials** (v10.8.4)
- Platform: Windows 10 (Dell Inspiron 3520)
- Scan Type: Basic Network Scan (localhost - 192.168.x.x)
- Duration: Approx. 30 minutes

---

## üîê Identified Vulnerabilities:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SMB Signing Not Required

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Plugin ID:** 57608
- **Risk Score:** CVSS v3.0 Base Score - 5.3
- **Description:**
  The system does not enforce SMB (Server Message Block) signing, allowing attackers to perform **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attacks on SMB traffic.
- **Risk:**
  An unauthenticated attacker could intercept or modify SMB traffic, leading to sensitive data leaks or session hijacking.
- **Fix Implemented:**
  Changed the registry key value from `0` to `1` to enable mandatory SMB signing.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Plugin ID:** 51192
- **Risk Score:** CVSS v3.0 Base Score - 6.5
- **Description:**
  The SSL certificate presented by the system is **self-signed**, expired, or from an untrusted certificate authority. This breaks the chain of trust.
- **Risk:**
  Attackers can exploit this misconfiguration to carry out **phishing**, **impersonation**, or **MitM** attacks on encrypted traffic.
- **Suggested Fix:**
  Use a valid, signed SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

## üì∏ Attached Screenshots:
- See the `screenshots/` folder for proof of the vulnerabilities detected:
  - `smb_signing_not_required.png`
  - `ssl_certificate_untrusted.png`

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome:
- Gained practical experience in running a vulnerability scanner.
- Understood how to interpret security findings and apply real-world fixes.
- Enhanced awareness about common PC risks such as SMB misconfigurations and certificate issues.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes:
- The scan was done on a home network using a mobile hotspot.
- Remediation of SMB issue was successfully verified by system restart and re-scan.
- SSL fix not applied as the system does not serve public HTTPS content.
