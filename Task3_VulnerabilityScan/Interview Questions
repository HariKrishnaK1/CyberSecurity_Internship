üìù Task 3: Vulnerability Scan ‚Äì Interview Questions & Answers
1. What is vulnerability scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is the process of automatically inspecting a system to find security weaknesses. It helps identify unpatched software, misconfigurations, or known issues that could be exploited.

2. Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?

Vulnerability Scanning is automatic and checks for known vulnerabilities.

Penetration Testing is manual or semi-automated and tries to actually exploit the vulnerabilities to see how far an attacker could go.

3. What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?

SMB signing not enabled

Outdated software

Untrusted SSL certificates

Open ports and weak services

Missing patches and insecure settings

4. How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?
Scanners use a database of known vulnerabilities and check the system's services, ports, and configurations to see if any of those issues exist.

5. What is CVSS?
CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System. It gives a severity score (0 to 10) to a vulnerability based on how easy it is to exploit and how much damage it can cause.

6. How often should vulnerability scans be performed?
It‚Äôs best to run scans monthly for personal use, and weekly or daily for organizations or sensitive systems.

7. What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?
A false positive is when the scanner reports a vulnerability, but in reality, it's not actually a threat or not applicable to that system.

8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?
Based on their CVSS score:

High (7.0 ‚Äì 10.0): Fix immediately

Medium (4.0 ‚Äì 6.9): Fix soon

Low (0 ‚Äì 3.9): Monitor or fix if possible
Also consider the impact, exploitability, and whether it‚Äôs actively being attacked.
